## **Algorithms and Data Structures**
This repository documents my learning journey of Advanced Data Structures (ADS) and algorithms. Here, you'll find codes, explanations, and insights gained from various resources and hands-on exercises.

## **Topics:**
    1. Course Introduction and Review:
   
        ● Complexity
        ● Memory

  
    2. Basic Data Structures:

        ● Stack
        ● Queue
        ● Deque
        ● Linked lists
        ● Doubly-Linked lists

        
    3. Sorting and Searching:

        ● Linear search
        ● Binary search
        ● Binary search tree
        ● Priority queues
        ● Heap sort
        ● Merge sort
        ● Quick sort


    4. Text Processing:

        ● Rabin-Karp algorithm
        ● Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm
        ● Trie algorithm

    
    5. Algorithms on Graphs:

        ● Graph representation: adjacency list, matrix, edge list
        ● BFS (Breadth-First Search)
        ● DFS (Depth-First Search)
        ● Topological Sort
        ● Spanning tree algorithms (Kruskal, Prim)
        ● Dijkstra
        ● Ford-Bellman
        ● Floyd

## **Usage**

  In **files** you can find tasks/labs, and practice.

  In **codes** you can find my own solutions for each task.
